## 📝 General Info

* This is a multipage website about natural recipes with honey, the idea of the project starting from my father who is a beekeeper and who proposed to me to create a website where we can generate a list of natural recipes that can be made with honey.
* This project is based on a web interface built from scratch by me, the display logic and functionality behind each page being implemented at the same time with my own ideas.
